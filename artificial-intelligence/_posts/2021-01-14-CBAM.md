# CBAM : Convolutional Block Attention Module

# 0. Abstract

1.  our module sequentially infers attention maps along two separate dimensions
2.   the attention maps are multiplied to the input feature map for **adaptive feature refinement** (향상되어 정제된 feature)
3.   lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any CNN architectures



# 1. introduction

1. Recent Detectors
   1. recent researches  have mainly investigated depth, width(\#channel), and [cardinality](https://everyday-deeplearning.tistory.com/entry/%EC%B4%88-%EA%B0%84%EB%8B%A8-%EB%85%BC%EB%AC%B8%EB%A6%AC%EB%B7%B0ResNext)(같은 형태의 빌딩 블록의 갯수).
   2. VGGNet, ResNet, GoogLeNet has become deeper for rich representation(중요한 특징 표현력).
   3. GoogLeNet  and **Wide ResNet**(2016), width must be another important factor.
   4. **Xception** and **ResNeXt**, increase **the cardinality of a network** . the cardinality saves the total number of parameters and make results powerful than depth and width.
   5. significant visual attention papers 
      - \[16\] A recurrent neural network for image generation
      - \[17\] Spatial transformer networks
2. **Emphasize meaningful features / along those two principal dimensions / channel(depth) and spatial axes(x,y).** -> channel and spatial attention modules ->  learning which information to emphasize or suppress.

3. Contribution
   1. Can be widely applied to boost representation power of CNNs
   2. Extensive [ablation studies](https://cumulu-s.tistory.com/8)
   3. Performance of various networks is greatly improved

- channel attention values are **broadcast**ed along the spatial dimension

- ## **Channel attention module**

  - In the past, make model learn the extent of the target object  or compute spatial statistics.\[33\] \[28\]
  -  exploiting the inter-channel relationship of features.
  -  each channel is considered as a a feature detector.
  - ‘what’ is meaningful 
  - average pooling and max-pooling -> two different spatial context (F^c_avg and F^c_max)

  - W1, W0  are shared for both inputs and the ReLU activation function is followed by W0. r =  reduction ratio.

- ## **Spatial attention module**

  -  The design philosophy is symmetric with the channel attention branch.
  - \[34\] Paying more attention to attention, pooling along channel axis can be effective in highlighting **informative regions**. 
  - concatenated feature (both descriptor)

  -  σ : the sigmoid function,  the filter size of 7 × 7

- ## **Arrangement of attention modules**

  - the sequential arrangement gives a better result than a parallel arrangement. (첫번째 그림처럼. 직렬로. width하게 병렬로 NO)
  - our experimental result.

- Grad-CAM is a recently proposed visualization method.
- Grad-CAM uses gradients in order to calculate the importance of the spatial locations.
